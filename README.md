# Marketing Campaign Analysis

**Description**:  
Marketing teams often face challenges in understanding the performance of their campaigns across various channels, making it difficult to allocate budgets effectively and optimize strategies. To address this, we used Power BI to analyse the data and calculate the key metrics like ROAS (Return on Ad Spend), total spend, clicks, impressions, CTR (Click-Through Rate), CPM (Cost Per Mille), conversions, and conversion rate were analyzed across different marketing channels. This analysis provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of each channel. The impact of this work was a more data-driven approach to campaign management, allowing for better resource allocation and improved ROI.

**Key Achievements**:  
- Calculated and assessed ROAS to identify the most profitable campaigns and marketing channels.
- Analyzed spend, clicks, impressions, CTR, and CPM to optimize marketing budget allocation.
- Provided insights into campaign performance trends, focusing on revenue, conversions, and marketing channel effectiveness.
